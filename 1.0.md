# Visuality: Reforged 1.0

## Changes
- Moved most particle config to new json config system Particle Emitters.
- Moved all particle colors to extra parameters instead of using velocity.
- `visuality:sparkle` is now colorable, all use cases are tweaked to proper color.
- Hit particles now only spawn from melee attack.
- Hit particles now generates more with damage enchantments.
- Made `minecraft:wandering_trader` to spawn emerald particles on hit by default.
- Modified most particles' spawn interval due to code changes.
- Added Spanish-Mexican(es_mx) localization by @CerealConJugo.

## Particle Emitters
- Particle Emitter configs are located under `/config/visuality/particle_emitters/` folder, currently there are `block/ambient.json`, 
`block/step.json`, `entity/armor.json` and `entity/hit.json`.
- Particle Emitters can also be loaded via resource packs, located under `assets/<namespace>/particle_emitters/` folder with the same name.
- Particle Emitters in resource packs accept a `conditions` field like recipes which uses Forge's loading condition system, useful for loading mod specific stuffs.
- Particle Emitters reload along with resource packs (use F3+T for reload), Particle Emitter configs loads first.
- Particle Emitters from resource packs can only merge their `entries` field, other fields is only available for Particle Emitter configs.
- Further information about the format will be post on the GitHub Wiki later, reference the default Particle Emitter configs for now.
